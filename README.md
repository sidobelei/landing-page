# landing-page

The purpose of the landing page project is 
to model an entire web page from a design provided by The Odin Project.

Building off of what I learned about the box model and aligning elements on a webpage, I used CSS to recreate the elements from the example given. A majority of the web page was positioned using Flexbox.
